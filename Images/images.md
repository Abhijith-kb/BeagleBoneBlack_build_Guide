## Image 1: U-Boot Directory after Build

**Description:**  
This shows the contents of the U-Boot directory after building for BeagleBone Black (AM335x). The directory contains both build artifacts and source code folders.

**Key Files and Folders:**

- **u-boot.bin, u-boot.img**  
  U-Boot binary images. These are the main bootloader files loaded by the second-stage boot process.

- **MLO**  
  The second-stage bootloader for BeagleBone platforms. This is the first file loaded by the ROM on power-up and is essential for initializing the board and loading U-Boot.

- **u-boot.dtb**  
  Device Tree Blob for U-Boot. This describes the hardware layout to U-Boot, allowing it to adapt to different boards without code changes.

- **u-boot-dtb.img**  
  A combined image that includes both the U-Boot binary and its Device Tree Blob.  
  **Why is this needed?**  
  On boards like the BeagleBone Black, the boot ROM expects a single image that contains both the bootloader and the device tree. Using `u-boot-dtb.img` ensures that U-Boot is loaded with the correct hardware configuration, enabling proper initialization and booting of the board.

- **build-am335x.sh**  
  Build script tailored for AM335x boards (such as BeagleBone Black). Automates the configuration and build process.

- **drivers, cmd, board**  
  Source code directories:  
  - `drivers`: Contains hardware driver code.  
  - `cmd`: Implements U-Boot commands.  
  - `board`: Board-specific initialization and configuration files.

**Description:**  
This screenshot shows the output of the command:

arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc --version

**Details:**

- **Cross-Compiler Used:**  
  `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc` version **11.3.0**

- **Purpose:**  
  This cross-compiler is used to build U-Boot and the Linux kernel for ARM-based boards like the BeagleBone Black, ensuring that binaries run correctly on the target hardware.

## Image 3: Kernel Build Output

**Description:**  
This directory contains the output files generated after building the Linux kernel for BeagleBone Black.

**Key Files:**

- **5.15.177-bone43.zImage**  
  The compressed Linux kernel image to be loaded by U-Boot.

- **5.15.177-bone43-dtbs.tar.gz**  
  Archive containing Device Tree Blobs (DTBs) for supported boards. DTBs describe the hardware to the Linux kernel.

- **5.15.177-bone43-modules.tar.gz**  
  Archive of kernel modules. These can be extracted and installed on the root filesystem to provide additional kernel functionality.

- **config-5.15.177-bone43**  
  The kernel configuration file used for this build. Useful for debugging and for rebuilding the kernel with the same configuration.

## Summary Table

| Image | Description           | Key Files/Folders                                  | Purpose                                |
|-------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1     | U-Boot build output   | u-boot.bin, MLO, u-boot.dtb, u-boot-dtb.img, build-am335x.sh, drivers, cmd, board | Bootloader binaries, scripts, and source code |
| 2     | Cross-compiler version | arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc 11.3.0                      | Confirms toolchain used for ARM builds |
| 3     | Kernel build output    | zImage, dtbs.tar.gz, modules.tar.gz, config       | Kernel image, device trees, modules, config |

> **Tip:**  
> Always ensure you use the correct cross-compiler version and matching device tree files for your board to avoid boot issues.
